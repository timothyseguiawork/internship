      <h3>Typography is life!</h3>
      <p>I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. Even Michelangelo
        got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get
        real. A woman has the age she deserves. The key to my collections is sensuality. I try as much as possible to
        give you a great basic product and what comes out, I feel, is really amazing.</p>

      <h4>Classy</h4>
      <p>Money is the most corrosive aspect of life today because it means that all attention to detail is forgotten.
        The key to my collections is sensuality. I like the irony in my work. I would like the people that buy my
        clothes to understand that for me it's one small piece of art. I think there is something about luxury - it's
        not something people need, but it's what they want. It really pulls at their heart.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Typography is key. <strong>~Picaso</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Stylish</h4>
      <p>Money doesn't buy elegance. You can take an inexpensive sheath, add a pretty scarf, gray shoes, and a wonderful
        bag, and it will always be elegant. If I had the power, I would ban leggings. It's useless to send models out on
        the runway to cry. I think the idea of mixing luxury and mass-market fashion is very modern, very now - no one
        wears head-to-toe designer anymore. I love a black wedding dress.</p>
