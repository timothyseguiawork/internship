## Asks
1. "We put an image from our first big show in the `assets` folder. Add the photo to the page so the world can see how metal our shows are."
2. "We want to give away a pair of VIP tickets to a random fan. The page needs a form so people can submit their emails to enter the giveaway."
3. "We want the page's color scheme to look super metal. We all voted and decided the most metal color scheme would be a black background with white text and red links."
4. "Our bassist Bj√∏rn found a totally metal font on Google Fonts. The font is called `Metal Mania`. Can you make all of the text on the page that font? We added the font to the page already."

## LevelUp
- "Can you make the the name of the tour red? Just the text with the quotes."
- "That line across the page is too long. Can you make it shorter so it doesn't go to the edges of the page?"
- "Can you make sure the page looks nice? Like, center everything and make sure none of the content is too close together."
- "Our merch person told us about something called [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). They said you can use it to send form responses to an email address. Can you try it with your own email address and tell us if it works?"
