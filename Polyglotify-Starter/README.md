# Polyglotify

## Introduction
Polyglotify is the brainchild of a team of educators who believe they have come up with the most effective way of learning a new language. They need a website and itâ€™s going to have to look professional to inspire confidence in an industry dominated by big players (Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, etc.). We are going to help get their web presence off the ground. 

## Product and Technical Requirements

### Phase One

#### Hero Section
- Buttons
  - Should use Bootstrap button components.
  - 'Try for free' button should be yellow with dark text.
  - 'Login' button should be grey with light text. 
  - Should be sized larger than other buttons on the page.
- 'Polyglotify' heading
  - Should be very large.
  - Should have a different font from the rest of the page content.
  - The blurb beneath should be displayed as an h3.
- Center all content in the section horizontally

#### Navigation
- Convert list of navigation links to a responsive navbar component. (It should contain the same links!)
- Add the business name to the beginning of the navbar.
- Use a dark theme for the navbar - black background with white text. 

### Phase Two

#### About Section
- Keep section content from stretching to the edges of the window.
- Use a flush list group component for the "After six months" list.
#### Plans Section
- Create Bootstrap cards for each of the plan options.
- Turn each card's feature list into a Bootstrap list group component.
- Convert the "Select Plan" buttons to yellow button components.
- In the family plan card, make the "Best Value!" text a green Bootstrap badge with rounded edges.

## Stretch Goals
#### Method Section
- Turn the section content into a Bootstrap accordion component. The user should be able to open multiple items simultaneously.
- Make sure the section content is responsively sized and doesn't stretch to the edges of the window.

#### Miscellaneous
- Update the spacing (margin and padding) of cramped elements using Bootstrap's layout utilities.
