    <h2>Beat the heat with us this Summer!</h2>
    <img src="./assets/park.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      As we approach record high temperatures this Summer, we want to make sure
      everyone in San Bernardino County has a safe place to rest and cool off.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Summer long, we're setting up cooling stations all around the county.
      Stop by any of the locations below
      <strong>Monday through Sunday from 10am - 6pm</strong> to get out of the
      sun, drink some cold water, and enjoy some good company. We also have free
      hot weather supplies available: light clothes, reusable water bottles,
      umbrellas, and more. We'd love to see you!
    </p>
    <em>
      No stations near you? We're working to add new stations every week, so
      check back!
    </em>
